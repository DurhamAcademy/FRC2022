This is where vendor JSON files are placed to add motor control libraries, etc.
You can either get these JSON files yourself or use https://www.npmjs.com/package/frcdep to manage them.

Phoenix.json - manages a lot of the sensors connected with CAN bus (ie Pigeon)
REVRobotics.json - has CANSparkMax class which controls are motors / controllers
WPILibNewCommands.json - has a lot of standard FRC tools that we use

# In Sim
- reformat Shuffleboard (require driver-station)
- augmented loop (pg 109 of textbook)
  - detla U: add voltage into state model
    - https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/971s-control-system/137365/15?u=tatestaples
- current management
- fix native PID to acknowledge gear Ratios *** 
- figure out what pure pursuit it

# With robot
- climb testing
- test other turret controls (it they want to redo tether, than recharacterize)
  - velocity
  - state space (hard with bad ff)
- test disposal
- speed up zeroTurret
- test shot while moving
- test why auto shot slow
- test other shooter control schemes
  - inversion
  - native (probably good enough with the falcon)
  - full throttle
  - statespace
    - check how to use faster loop time
  - check changing tolerance
  - add I term
- flash other limelight (try)
  - tune ball detection
- speed up zeroTurret (or add faster version for when button not )

## random cool things
- Auto Drive to Climb
- Auto Climb

## Full Auto
- goal system (shouldn't be too hard - should update) -> moderate difficulty
  - limelight
- obstacles (can work on this) -> easy, just time intensive
- ball detection in hopper
  - figure out colors senrsors (talk to bots on wheels) -> with resourses, not that hard
  - pypico + 2 rev color sensors
- ability to reaccesss if lost for too long -> simple
- robot avoidance -> hard (try installing photon on picam or something)
- climb -> unknown, probably not bad but will need empirics
  - should add endgameInit or something (idk)

## Long Term
- Make sure things are isolatable (specifically autoDrive and Navigation)
- think about roborio2 (they said 30% faster)
- probably get falcons

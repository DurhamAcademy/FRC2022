# Future
- chief delphi post *
- resume
- github page
- ask Adair 

# In Sim
- get chrp files
- fix debugs

# With robot
- try Everett's climb idea
- teach group about how kyberlib works
  - ask about position vs linearPosition preferences
- try replacing flywheel colsons
- better turning in difdrive dynamics
  - skid factor mentioned in 254 code

# Short-term what better
- operator controls (2 drivers)
- no hopper
- less violent intake
- inertia wheels?

# longer-term what better
- testing is valuable
- driver practice is important
- compact causes issues
  - have a plan for electronics (not necesarily CAD)
  - pnuematics take space, use with caution
  - leave room for mistakes and future innovations
- fundraising is a priority
- long-term planning and time estimation
- chairmans -> outreach
- look into working with other teams
  - builds connections
  - lets us practice with other robots
  - more fun
- fail fast and early
  - build before done
- name batteries
- build driverstation

# what good
- banging shooter
- working climb
- LEDs
- awards!
- student led team
- no COTS
- overcoming hurdles

## Full Auto
- goal system (shouldn't be too hard - should update) -> moderate difficulty
    - limelight
- obstacles (can work on this) -> easy, just time intensive
- ball detection in hopper
    - figure out colors senrsors (talk to bots on wheels) -> with resourses, not that hard
    - pypico + 2 rev color sensors
- ability to reaccesss if lost for too long -> simple
- robot avoidance -> hard (try installing photon on picam or something)
- climb -> unknown, probably not bad but will need empirics
    - should add endgameInit or something (idk)

## Long Term
- think about roborio2 (they said 30% faster)

          - I am a senior
    - motor control systems integration
      - purpose
        - rapid iteration
          - can write a bunch of different control schemes and swap them out to see what worked
            - had 6 different control schemes for flywheel at one point
          - single line of code change to switch motors
          - allow for simple simulation support
        - personal learning
        - usability for new coders

    - Simulation support
        - why important for our robot (time)
            - 3 days of testing
        - easy way to write code for subsystems not there
            - simulated ESC
            - fake solenoids
            - halucinating climb past 2 events

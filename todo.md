# In Sim
- color sensors
- reformat Shuffleboard (require driver-station)
- mess around with NT Sendable  ** 
  - ff & pid & statespace
  - add sendable for each subsystem for tuning
- check for anything wrong in kyberlib that could cause the issue
- make debug better


# With robot
- test why auto shot slow
- test other shooter control schemes
  - inversion
  - native
  - full throttle
  - statespace
    - check how to use faster loop time
  - check changing tolerance
- flash other limelight
  - tune ball detection
- test other turret controls
  - velocity 
  - state space (hard with bad ff)
- test disposal
- speed up zeroTurret (or add faster version for when button not )

## random cool things
- Auto Drive to Climb
- Auto Climb
- acceleration calculations

## Full Auto
- goal system (shouldn't be too hard - should update) -> moderate difficulty
  - limelight
- obstacles (can work on this) -> easy, just time intensive
- ball detection in hopper
  - figure out colors senrsors (talk to bots on wheels) -> with resourses, not that hard
- ability to reaccesss if lost for too long -> simple
- robot avoidance -> hard (try installing photon on picam or something)
- climb -> unknown, probably not bad but will need empirics
  - should add endgameInit or something (idk)

## Long Term
- Make sure things are isolatable (specifically autoDrive and Navigation)
- think about roborio2 (they said 30% faster)
- probably get falcons

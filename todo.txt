In Sim:
Full Auto Climb?
Refractor some variables
Make sure things are isolatable
documentation of kyberlib
emergency mode
detect CAN issues
control schemas
mario kart (idk if possible)

With robot:
Tune feedforwards
Auto paths
inversion issue

Anyone can do:
1. mess with auto paths
How? -->
search for Pathweaver.jar on your laptop
open the availble project
drag around the nodes until you like the line.
find the save button (it's something like build path)
move output into code (Pathweaver/output to src/main.deploy
switch the name of the auto path in Robot.kt

2. Conveyor Code
3. Try auto climb

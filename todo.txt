In Sim:
ask trevor what proper cheesy drive is (also any additional plans he had for Overthrow)
Make sure things are isolatable (specifically autoDrive and Navitation)
think about roborio2 (they said 30% faster)

With robot:
shooter calibration
turret recalibration
PhotonVision update
test if drivecode acts like expected
Shooter test values
Auto paths

Anyone can do:
1: mount hall sensor or limit switch for turret
1.5: mount hood limit switch
2: mess with auto paths
How? -->
- search for Pathweaver.jar on your laptop
- open the availble project
- drag around the nodes until you like the line.
- find the save button (it's something like build path)
- move output into code (Pathweaver/output to src/main.deploy
- switch the name of the auto path in Robot.kt
4: documentation of kyberlib (good project to try to understand whats happening)
5: Try auto climb

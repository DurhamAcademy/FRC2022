Auto paths

Anyone can do:
1. mess with auto paths
How? -->
search for Pathweaver.jar on your laptop
open the availble project
drag around the nodes until you like the line.
find the save button (it's something like build path)
move output into code (Pathweaver/output to src/main.deploy
switch the name of the auto path in Robot.kt

2. Conveyor Code (Everetts messing with this)
3. documentation of kyberlib (good project to try to understand whats happening)
3. Try auto climb

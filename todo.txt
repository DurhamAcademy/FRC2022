In Sim:
Make sure things are isolatable (specifically autoDrive and Navitation)
think about roborio2 (they said 30% faster)

With robot:
shooter calibration
    - PIDF
    - statespace
    - feedforward
    - ff with voltage drop predictor
turret recalibration
PhotonVision update
setup shuffleboard
Shooter test values
Auto paths

Fancy shooter things:
- movement compensation
    - this would require better integration between turret and shooter
- make sure to calculate output velocity (based on time of flight) during calibration
    - for now can estimate time of flight as constant
    - iteratively figure out what is should be

Anyone can do:
2: mess with auto paths
How? -->
- search for Pathweaver.jar on your laptop
- open the availble project
- drag around the nodes until you like the line.
- find the save button (it's something like build path)
- move output into code (Pathweaver/output to src/main.deploy
- switch the name of the auto path in Robot.kt
4: documentation of kyberlib (good project to try to understand whats happening)
5: Try auto climb

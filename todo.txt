In Sim:
Turret
zero turret before hall sensor. Spasing coming from accumulated position
make Shoot manual and Force shot work
make LockTurret and enure it works
Make sure things are isolatable (specifically autoDrive)
detect CAN issues
emergency mode (low priority)
kyberlib optimizations
think about roborio2

With robot:
Drivetrain Sim
Turret tuning
loop times
Tune feedforwards
Auto paths

Anyone can do:
1. mount hall sensor or limit switch for turret
2. mess with auto paths
How? -->
- search for Pathweaver.jar on your laptop
- open the availble project
- drag around the nodes until you like the line.
- find the save button (it's something like build path)
- move output into code (Pathweaver/output to src/main.deploy
- switch the name of the auto path in Robot.kt

3. Conveyor Code (Everetts messing with this)
4. documentation of kyberlib (good project to try to understand whats happening)
5. Try auto climb

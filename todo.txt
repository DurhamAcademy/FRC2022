In Sim:
fancy drivetrain
ask trevor what proper cheesy drive is (also any additional plans he had for Overthrow)
Make sure things are isolatable (specifically autoDrive)
kyberlib optimizations
think about roborio2

With robot:
Drivetrain characterization
Turret tuning
loop times - maybe resolved
Tune feedforwards
Auto paths

Anyone can do:
1. mount hall sensor or limit switch for turret
2. mess with auto paths
How? -->
- search for Pathweaver.jar on your laptop
- open the availble project
- drag around the nodes until you like the line.
- find the save button (it's something like build path)
- move output into code (Pathweaver/output to src/main.deploy
- switch the name of the auto path in Robot.kt

3. Conveyor Code (Everetts messing with this)
4. documentation of kyberlib (good project to try to understand whats happening)
5. Try auto climb
